	/*
	  An unexpected, unwanted event that disturbs the normal flow of the program is called Exception.
	  
	  Ex: FileNotFound,SleepingExcepton etc.
	  
	  It's highly recommeneded to handle exceptions the main objective of exception handling is graceful termination of the program.
	  
	  Exception handling doesn't mean repairing an excepton. We have to provide an alternative way to continue rest of the program normally is the concept of exception handling.
	  
	  For example our programming requirement is to read data from remote file locating at London. At runtime if Londing file is not available our program shouldn't terminated abnormally. We have to provide some local file to continue rest of the program normally. This way of defining alternative is nothing but exception handling.
